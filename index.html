  <h2><strong>Research Expertise and Contributions</strong></h2>
  <p>
    I am an interdisciplinary scientist dedicated to investigating the intertwined crises of biodiversity loss, climate change, and deteriorating human health. 
    I employ a transdisciplinary lens and mixed methods to bridge nature and human perspectives. Broadly, my projects aim to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Examine how human health is impacted by climate change and biodiversity loss</li>
    <li>Understand how nature is changing due to human actions</li>
    <li>Develop effective and equitable solutions that secure positive outcomes for nature and people</li>
  </ul>
  <br>

  <h2><strong>Global Experience and Interdisciplinary Perspective</strong></h2>
  <p>
    Having worked in Asia, Australia, and Europe, I bring a global perspective to research and teaching. 
    My research bridges diverse sociocultural and environmental contexts. In Southeast Asia and Pacific Islands, I have co-developed ecological forest restoration techniques with local communities 
    (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2016.12.021" target="_blank">Oh et al., 2017, Ecological Engineering</a>). In Europe, I led projects evaluating how nature-based solutions impact human health through reducing urban heat stress 
    (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.16419" target="_blank">Gillerot et al., Global Change Biology</a>).
    I have also demonstrated that different nature experiences benefit different health outcomes depending on the community. 
    For example, engaging in biodiversity citizen science can reduce stress and anxiety but not depressive symptoms 
    (<a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2025.1461601" target="_blank">Oh et al., Frontiers in Environmental Science</a>).
  </p>
  <p>
    My multilingual capabilities and cross-cultural background have strengthened my ability to work across diverse populations and academic contexts.

      Snapshots from the field: Sometimes research means pottering through Southeast Asia’s mangroves, baking in the Australian desert, or pretending not to get lost in a European forest.

  <h2><strong>Track Record of Collaboration and Impact</strong></h2>
  <p>
    My research has been cited in policy documents by the Singapore Government, the World Bank, and the United Nations, reflecting its local-to-global relevance. 
    I was recently awarded the <a href="https://gfoe.org/en/gfoe-awards/gfoe-prize" target="_blank">Gfö Prize by the Ecological Society of Germany</a>, Austria and Switzerland, 
    recognizing my scientific achievements, leadership, and dedication to mentoring young researchers.
  </p>
  <p>
    I currently serve as an Associate Editor for <a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/25758314" target="_blank">People and Nature</a>, and I am committed to fostering diversity and inclusion in academia 
    (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/cobi.14325" target="_blank">Valdez et al., 2024</a>).

  <h2><strong>I'm Only Human ;)</strong></h2>
  <p>
    My life extends beyond my office door. I love to travel, especially to remote ecosystems where I can experience nature on the edge, and biodiversity up close. 
    So don’t be surprised if my out-of-office reply includes a GPS coordinate!
    That said, I’m equally content being a couch potato with a great book or fiddling with some craft or upcycling project. <em>Balance, after all, is a science too.</em>

      One of my happiest moments — observing a wolverine forage in the wild. Spotting one is incredibly rare, and I still can't believe we were lucky enough to witness it! Photo credit: Benjamin Oh
