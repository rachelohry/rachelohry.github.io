  <h3><strong>Research expertise and contributions</strong></h3>
  <h1>
    I am an interdisciplinary scientist dedicated to investigating the intertwined crises of human health, climate change and environmental degradation. 
    My research employs a transdisciplinary lens and mixed methods to bridge health and sustainability perspectives. 
    I examine how physical, mental and social human health are impacted by environmental changes, including climate change and biodiversity loss. 
    For example, I have investigated how nature-based solutions impact human health through mitigating climate change effects 
    <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.17123" target="_blank">Gillerot et al., Global Change Biology</a>. 
    I have also explored drivers of pro-environmental behaviours, identifying how societal values and social norms shape these behaviours 
    (Sockhill et al., People and Nature; Oh et al., People and Nature).
