We are always happy to hear from anyone who is interested in working with us, as a PhD or honours student, an independent post-doc or a visitor. Please drop me an email (r.oh[at]uq.edu.au).

### Important 

I recommend that you talk to current and former team members if you're thinking about working with us, to help you get a clearer picture of what our research environment is like. 
Every research team operates differently, and you should feel confident that this group's culture and expectations aligns with yours. You can find our contact information on the **People** page (_working on it!_). 
Don’t hesitate to reach out — it's a smart step ;)
