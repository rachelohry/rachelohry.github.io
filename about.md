title: About 
---

We live in a time marked by the convergence of global crises relating to biodiversity loss, climate change, and deteriorating human health. Rooted at the human-nature interface, these are highly-complex problems that require immediate, effective solutions.

Based at the **National University of Singapore**, my team and I study how people interact with the natural world around them, and how these interactions impact outcomes related to **nature conservation, and human health**. 

In these complex social-ecological systems, there are no simple solutions, and doing nothing is not an option. We conduct **interdisciplinary, multilingual research** that span urban ecology, conservation psychology, and public health disciplines. Our scientific ouputs are also translated into developing **evidence-based strategies and policies**. Our work is motivated by the urgency to act, and by a belief that informed and inclusive strategies can drive meaningful change for both people and the planet.

### Our Philosophy

We are committed to fostering a nuturing research environment grounded in **inclusivity, integrity, and communication**. We emphasise the important of **respect, empathy and support** between lab members, and value **diverse voices and perspectives**.

We recognise the systemic inequalities pervasive in society and within the scientific community, and will work to ensure that our research and actions contribute to meaningful progress in overcoming these challenges. We hold ourselves to the highest standards of **rigour and integrity**, while embracing continuous learning. In doing so, we aim to produce innovative and impactful research to drive meaningful change for both people and the world.
